# AGENTS.md

This guide covers best practices for building environments with `verifiers` and using them to train and evaluate LLMs. It is downloaded automatically using the setup script below (which has likely already been run if you're reading this). See `environments/AGENTS.md` for more details.

---

Verifiers is our library for creating environments to train and evaluate LLMs.

Environments contain everything required to run and evaluate a model on a particular task:
- A *dataset* of task inputs
- A *harness* for the model (tools, sandboxes, context management, etc.)
- A reward function or *rubric* to score the model's performance

Environments can be used for training models with reinforcement learning (RL), evaluating capabilities, generating synthetic data, experimenting with agent harnesses, and more. 

Verifiers is tightly integrated with the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars), as well as our training framework [prime-rl](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl) and our [Hosted Training](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/training) platform.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have `uv` installed, as well as the `prime` CLI tool:
```bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# install the prime CLI
uv tool install prime
# create a new project if needed
uv init
```

Then, add `verifiers` to your project:
```bash
uv add verifiers
```

To set up your workspace for developing environments, do:
```bash
prime lab setup
```

This creates the recommended workspace structure and downloads useful starter files:
```
configs/
├── endpoints.py        # OpenAI-compatible API endpoint configuration
└── lab/                # Example configs for Hosted Training
environments/
└── AGENTS.md           # Documentation for AI coding agents
AGENTS.md               # Top-level documentation for AI coding agents
CLAUDE.md               # Claude-specific pointer to AGENTS.md
```

Environments built with Verifiers are self-contained Python modules. To initialize a fresh environment template, do:
```bash
prime env init my-env # creates a new template in ./environments/my_env
```

This will create a new module called `my_env` with a basic environment template.
```
environments/my_env/
├── my_env.py           # Main implementation
├── pyproject.toml      # Dependencies and metadata
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

Environment modules should expose a `load_environment` function which returns an instance of the Environment object, and which can accept custom arguments. For example: 
```python
# my_env.py
import verifiers as vf

def load_environment(dataset_name: str = 'gsm8k') -> vf.Environment:
    dataset = vf.load_example_dataset(dataset_name) # 'question'
    async def correct_answer(completion, answer) -> float:
        completion_ans = completion[-1]['content']
        return 1.0 if completion_ans == answer else 0.0
    rubric = Rubric(funcs=[correct_answer])
    env = vf.SingleTurnEnv(dataset=dataset, rubric=rubric)
    return env
```

To install the environment module into your project, do:
```bash
prime env install my-env
```

To run a quick local evaluation with OpenAI-compatible models, do:
```bash
prime eval run my-env -m gpt-5-nano # run and save eval results locally
```

To publish the environment to the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars), do:
```bash
prime env push --path ./environments/my_env
```

To run an evaluation directly from the Environments Hub, do:
```bash
prime eval run primeintellect/math-python
``` 

To install an environment from the Environments Hub into your project, do:
```bash
prime env install primeintellect/math-python
```
